        It is the most visited place in Ecuador, just 30 minutes from Quito, it
        is the monument that celebrates the equinoctial location of our country.
        North of Quito, in the parish of San Antonio de Pichincha, is the most
        visited attraction in the country, the Middle of the World monument and
        complex dedicated to the equinoctial line. Here the tourist's favorite
        activity is to take a photo on the yellow line painted on the cement
        that divides the planet into two parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The power of the Middle of the World is a universal reality: the
        position of the Earth in front of the sun, and being at Zero Latitude,
        which is no longer a geographical line, is part of science, spirituality
        and knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>A little history</h3>
      <p>
        In the 18th century, at the beginning of the modern age, the Age of
        Enlightenment, the century of geographical study of the Earth, a group
        of French scientists arrived in Quito in 1736 to determine the meridian
        arc in the equinoctial zone of the planet. . In reality, our country
        owes its name precisely to this fact.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team of specialists carried out their measurements through the
        rugged Andes, suffering all kinds of adversities. This mission was
        planned to last three years and in the end it ended after 10 years.

        This historic district was the first city named a UNESCO World Heritage
        Site and is noted for its narrow streets, Spanish colonial architecture

      <h4>Sucre Theater</h4>
      <p>
        Its grandeur responds to the high cultural offering it has, it is an
        obligatory step when visiting the Historic Center. The square where it
        is located bears that name due to its presence; it can be said that this
        is the theater of the city.

      <h4>Metropolitan Cathedral of Quito</h4>

      <p>
        Considered the oldest Cathedral in South America, and one of the oldest
        Spanish temples in America, it is its walls and domes that have
        witnessed some of the most important events in the capital. It is a
        special place… unique, located in the heart of the city. It has been a
        resting place for rulers and a place of devotion to the heroes of
        Independence. The Cathedral is full of stories.

        Its beautiful façade, its atrium with its curious spheres, or
        “Carondelet balls” as they are colloquially called, each one with a
        different motif, and its beautiful stone steps make it one of the most
        important attractions of the Plaza Grande.
      </p>
      <h4>Company of Jesus Church</h4>
      <p>
        The Company leaves anyone breathless: a perfect jewel, packed from head
        to toe in gold leaf (7 tons!), it is one of America's most prized
        architectural creations. With light entrances that gloriously illuminate
        its interior and a carving of God on the altar that during a peak moment
        of the day, receives the sun on its face during the equinox, the beauty
        of this temple is unforgettable at first sight. It is enough to admire
        anyone, but, like everything baroque, its greatness is in the details.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all starts with the façade, the most attractive in the entire city.
        It is basically an altar, but placed on the street, with images of Saint
        Peter and Saint Paul, the main Jesuit saints, the heart of Jesus and
        Mary, the Immaculate Virgin, the Holy Spirit and the symbol of the
        Eucharist. covering the construction like a relief mural from floor to
        ceiling. For the people of Quito, in addition to its architectural,
        historical and aesthetic value, the church of La Compañía has enormous
        mystical value, since it is in this temple where the first saint of
        Quito, Santa Mariana de Jesús, rests and where, in the chapel located,
        accessible from Benalcázar street, the miracle of the Virgin Dolorosa
        occurred at the beginning of the 20th century: the image closed its eyes
        in front of 35 young students from the San Gabriel school.

      <h4>Basilica of the National Vote</h4>
      <p>
        One sees it in the distance from many places in Quito. It is a
        monumental structure, one of the most important in the city and no
        wonder, it has taken more than 100 years to build, with details that are
        still being built today. It rests right at the base of the San Juan
        neighborhood and what was the Huanaucari, a sacred hill in pre-Columbian
        times. Today, it is the most prominent temple in the city, made in a
        striking neo-Gothic style.

      <p>
        Walking in primary, intact nature, full of life, which is a privilege of
        Quito residents. Come with us to Quito and walk towards wild routes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can explore a cloud forest full of vines, an untamed wasteland,
        climb a mountain or cross a temperate grove of trees no more than 30
        minutes by car from the city center. Short, long, half-day, multi-day,
        difficult, easy, moderate walks... for all tastes.
      </p>
      <h3>We recommend you visit:</h3>
      <h4>Guagua Pichincha Volcano</h4>
      <p>
        A set of peaks unique in the world takes care of Quito. A getaway at
        more than 4,000 meters above sea level is the ideal getaway for
        adventure, recreation and contact with nature.
      </p>

      <!-- <a href="#">More images here</a> -->
      <h4>Cayambe-Coca National Park</h4>
      <p>
        Fabulous natural environments, volcanoes, paramo, jungle, trekking,
        rafting and climbing adventures, in one of the doors to the Amazon and a
        large waterfall await you in this unique area. While reaching one of the
        entrances to Cayambe Coca National Park takes about an hour from Quito
        by car, exploring its beauty could take days or weeks.
      </p>
      <img src="./images/cayambe.jpg" alt="cayambe" />
      <!-- <a href="#">More images here</a> -->
      <h4>Antisana Volcano</h4>
      <p>
        It rises about 50 kilometers from the city, passing over the Eastern
        Cordillera, between the Cayambe and Cotopaxi volcanoes. Unlike its
        neighbors, Antisana is almost never seen from Quito.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Antisana there are wet and dry ecosystems, forests and swamps with
        wildlife as striking as the mountain tapir and flora as beautiful as the
        chuquirahua, the national flower of Ecuador. You can visit the house
        where Humboldt stayed at the beginning of the 19th century, in the old
        hacienda known as “La Ovejería”, where, decades later, the Spanish
        troops would plan their final assault on Quito, in 1822 for the feat of
        the Independence.
